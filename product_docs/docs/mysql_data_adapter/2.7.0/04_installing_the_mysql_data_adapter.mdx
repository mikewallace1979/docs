### On RHEL 8

Before installing the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper, you must install the following prerequisite packages, and request credentials from EDB:

Install the `epel-release` package:

```text
dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```

Enable the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-\*-rpms` repository:

```text
ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
```

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

```text
dnf -y https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EDB user.

```text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```
**Installing MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper**

After saving your changes to the configuration file, use the below command to install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper:

```text
dnf install edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw
```
Where `xx` is the server version number i.e. 13.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:
   ```text
   sudo su –
   ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    On Debian 9:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    On Debian 10, Ubuntu 18, and Ubuntu 20:

    1.  Set up the EDB repository:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    2.  Substitute your EDB credentials for the `username` and `password` in the following command:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
    ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

   ```text
   apt-get install apt-transport-https
   ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:
