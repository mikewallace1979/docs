The Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper (`hdfs_fdw`) is a Postgres extension that allows you to access data that resides on a Hadoop file system from EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The foreign data wrapper makes the Hadoop file system a read-only data source that you can use with Postgres functions and utilities, or in conjunction with other data that resides on a Postgres host.

The Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper can be installed with an RPM package. You can download an installer from the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres/).

This guide uses the term `Postgres` to refer to an instance of EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
