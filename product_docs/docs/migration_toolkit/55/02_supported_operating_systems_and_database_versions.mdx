!!! Note
    The Migration Toolkit isn't tested with and doesn't officially support use with Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Exadata. However, Migration Toolkit might work when it is connected to a single persistent node. For more information, contact your EDB representative.

## Supported operating systems versions

Migration Toolkit supports installations on Linux, Windows, and MacOS platforms. See [Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#mtk) for details.


!!! Note
    The ojdbc7.jar can cause large data migrations to be incomplete due to a limit on records over Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) while fetching from the ResultSet. To avoid this issue, we recommend upgrading to ojdbc8.jar.
