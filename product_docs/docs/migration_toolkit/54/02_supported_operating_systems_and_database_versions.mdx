!!! Note
    The Migration Toolkit has not been tested and does not officially support use with Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Exadata. However, Migration Toolkit may work when it is connected to a single persistent node. For more information, contact your EDB representative.

**Supported Operating Systems Versions**

Migration Toolkit supports installations on Linux, Windows, and MacOS platforms. See [Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#mtk) for details.

!!! Note
    The ojdbc7.jar can cause large data migrations to be incomplete due to a limit on records over Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) while fetching from the ResultSet. To avoid this issue, we recommend upgrading to ojdbc8.jar.
