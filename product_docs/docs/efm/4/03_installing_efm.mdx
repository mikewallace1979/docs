For information about the platforms and versions supported by Failover Manager, see [Platform Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#efm).

!!! Note

    A mixed mode for CPU architecture is supported where the primary and standby nodes are on Linux on IBM Power and witness node is on x86-64 Linux.

To request credentials that allow you to access an EnterpriseDB repository, see the [EDB Repository Access instructions](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

## RedHat/CentOS/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux host

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that isn't recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press **Return** to continue.

During the installation, yum might encounter a dependency that it can't resolve. If it does, it provides a list of the required dependencies to manually resolve.

Failover Manager must be installed by root. During the installation process, the installer also creates a user named efm that has privileges to invoke scripts that control the Failover Manager service for clusters owned by enterprisedb or postgres.

After receiving your credentials, you must create the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file on each node of the cluster and then modify the file to enable access. 

### RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8 x86-64 host

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:
    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace ‘USERNAME:PASSWORD’ below with your username and password for the EDB repositories:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Install the EPEL repository:

-   On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8
    ```text
    dnf -y install epel-release
    ```
-   On RHEL 8
    ```text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  Enable the additional repositories to resolve dependencies:

-   On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8
    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```
-   On RHEL 8

    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

5.  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```
6.  Install the selected package:
    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-efm42
    ```

### RHEL or CentOS 7 x86-64 host

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace ‘USERNAME:PASSWORD’ with your username and password for the EDB repositories:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Install the EPEL repository:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  On RHEL 7, enable the additional repositories to resolve dependencies:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

5.  Install the selected package:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-efm42
    ```

### RHEL 8 ppc64le host
There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```shell
sudo su -
```

#### Setting up the Repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

1. Set up the EDB repository:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```

   This creates the /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo configuration file.

1. Add your EDB credentials to the edb.repo file:  

   ```shell
   sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
   ```

   Where `USERNAME:PASSWORD` is the username and password available from your
   [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

1. Install the EPEL repository and refresh the cache:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
   dnf makecache
   ```

1. Enable the codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-\*-rpms repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it:

   ```shell
   ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
   subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
   ```

1. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
   ```shell
   dnf -qy module disable postgresql
   ```

#### Installing the Package

```shell
dnf -y install edb-efm<xx>
```
where `<xx>` is the version number of Failover Manager.

### RHEL 7 ppc64le host

1.  Create a configuration file and install Advance Toolchain:

    ```text
    rpm --import https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b

    cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/advance-toolchain.repo <<EOF
    # Begin of configuration file
    [advance-toolchain]
    name=Advance Toolchain IBM FTP
    baseurl=https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7
    failovermethod=priority
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHELX/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    # End of configuration file
    EOF
    ```

2.  Install the EDB repository:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

3.  Replace ‘USERNAME:PASSWORD’ with your username and password for the EDB repositories:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

4.  Install the EPEL repository:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

5.  On RHEL 7 ppc64le, enable the additional repositories to resolve EPEL dependencies:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

6.  Install the selected package:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-efm42
    ```




## Debian or Ubuntu host

To install Failover Manager, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, see the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login).

Use the EnterpriseDB APT repository to install Failover Manager.

### Debian host

1.  Assume superuser privileges:
    ```text
    sudo su – 
    ```
2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository by substituting your EnterpriseDB credentials for the username and password placeholders in the following commands:

-   On Debian 9
    ```text

    ```
-   On Debian 10

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'

    sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
    ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:
    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```
4.  Add the EDB signing key:
    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    ```
5.  Update the repository meta data:
    ```text

    ```

## SLES Host

To install Failover Manager, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, see the instructions to [access EDB software repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

You can use the `zypper` package manager to install a Failover Manager agent on an SLES 12 host. `zypper` attempts to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing Failover Manager. Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

2.  The commands create the repository configuration files in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

    When prompted, provide credentials for the repository, specify to always trust the provided key, and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

3.  Add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    SUSEConnect -r <registration_number> -e <user_id>
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64
    ```

4.  Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
    ```

5.  Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java-based components:

    ```text
    zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
    ```

6.  Use the `zypper` utility to install a Failover Manager agent:

    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-efm42
    ```

## Performing post-installation tasks

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node.
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).
