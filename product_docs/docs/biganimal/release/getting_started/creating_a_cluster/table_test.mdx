1. In the **Instance Type** section, 
   | Azure | AWS |
   | ----- | --- |
   | Select the category that works best for your applications and workload: | |

memory optimized for large data sets
compute optimized for compute bound applications
general purpose if you don't require memory or compute optimization
- For Azure
      1. Select the category that works best for your applications and workload: memory optimized for large data sets, memory optimized for large data sets, or memory optimized for large data sets and then select the instance series and size. See [Sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) for information to help you choose the appropriate instance type. | 

      
         - memory optimized for large data sets
         - compute optimized for compute bound applications
         - general purpose if you don't require memory or compute optimization 
      1. Select the instance series and size. 
     See [Sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) for information to help you choose the appropriate instance type.
    - For AWS 
      1. Select the instance type (EC2 R5 or Rb5). 
5.  In the **Storage** section, select **Volume Type**. In **Volume Properties**, select the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster.
    - For Azure
      - BigAnimal currently supports Azure Premium SSD storage types. See [the Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssds) for more information.
    - For AWS 
      1. Select your storage type: io2 Provisioned IOPS SSD or io2 Block Express Provisioned IOPS SSD (only available for R5b class instance types)
      1. Choose your disk size.
      1. 
Users can choose their disk size and then configure their IOPs. The throughput will be automatically calculated for them by BigAnimal based on the IOPs input.

      - The AWS Free Trial supports AWS GPS Volumes. You can select 1-4 as the size. IOPS is calculated based on the storage size you select and disk throughput is calculated based on the IOPS value.
