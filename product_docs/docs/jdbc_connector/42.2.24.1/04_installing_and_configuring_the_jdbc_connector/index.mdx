This chapter describes how to install and configure the EDB JDBC Connector.

Before installing the EDB JDBC Connector, you must have Java installed on your system; you can download a Java installer that matches your environment from the Oracle Java Downloads [website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Documentation that contains detailed installation instructions is available through the associated `Installation Instruction` links on the same page.

You can use the Advanced Server graphical installer or an RPM package to add the EDB JDBC Connector to your installation.

The following sections describe these installation methods.
