title: Migration Portal quick start
---
To migrate Oracle schemas using Migration Portal:

1. Generate a .sql file with metadata information of your schemas using Oracle Data Pumpâ€™s command line clients `expdp` and `impdp`. For more information, see [Performing a schema extraction](../04_mp_migrating_database/01_mp_schema_extraction).

1. Log in to [Migration Portal](https://migration.enterprisedb.com/) with your EDB credentials.

1. Create a new project.

1. Upload the .sql file.

   !!! Note
   Uploading large DDL files might freeze or crash the browser (depending on the browser and the system resources in use). In this scenario, try running Migration Portal in a different browser or extracting fewer schemas and uploading that file on Migration Portal.

1. Select **Create & assess**.
   Migration Portal reviews every construct, executes repair actions to improve compatibility with EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and flags any remaining errors that require manual intervention.

1. Verify the DDL objects; for example, TABLES that do not show a 100% success ratio.

1. Select the objects that are not compatible with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

1. Refer to the Knowledge Base for checking the possible workarounds for the objects that are not compatible in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

1. Make the required changes and select **Reassess** to rerun the analysis.

1. After resolving errors in your schemas, you can download the modified EDB compatible DDL file and use any client application such as pgAdmin or PSQL client and migrate the schema to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. You can also migrate to EDB Postgres Advanced Server on  the cloud. For more information, see [Schema migration](../04_mp_migrating_database/03_mp_schema_migration).
