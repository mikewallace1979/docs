EDB Postgres Advanced Server v10 installers support Linux and Windows server platforms. 

!!! Note
    Advanced Server is no longer supported on RHEL/CentOS/OL 6.x platforms. It is strongly recommended that EDB products running on these platforms be migrated to a supported platform.

See [Platform Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)
 for additional information about supported platforms.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

-   The `data` directory of a production database should not be stored on an NFS file system.
