EDB Postgres Advanced Server v14 supports installations on Linux and Windows platforms. See [Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas) for details.

## Hardware Requirements

The following installation requirements assume you select the default options during the installation process. The minimum hardware requirements to install and run Advanced Server are:

-   1 GHz processor
-   2 GB of RAM
-   512 MB of HDD

Additional disk space is required for data or supporting components.

## Software Prerequisites

**User Privileges**

To perform an Advanced Server installation on a Linux system you must have superuser or administrator or sudo privileges.

To perform an Advanced Server installation on a Windows system you must have administrator privilege. If you are installing Advanced Server on a Windows system that is configured with `User Account Control` enabled, you can assume sufficient privileges to invoke the graphical installer by right clicking on the name of the installer and selecting `Run as administrator` from the context menu.

**Windows-specific Software Requirements**

Apply the Windows operating system updates before invoking the installer. If the installer encounters errors during the installation process, exit the installation and ensure that your Windows version is up-to-date before restarting the installer.


## Limitations

The following limitations apply to Advanced Server:

-   The `data` directory of a production database should not be stored on an NFS file system.
-   The LLVM JIT package is supported on RHEL or CentOS 7.x and 8.x only. LLVM JIT is not supported on PPC-LE 64 running RHEL or CentOS 7.x.
